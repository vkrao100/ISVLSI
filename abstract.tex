{\bf Abstract:} This paper addresses the problem of rectification of buggy integer arithmetic circuits using concepts from symbolic computer algebra. When formal verification identifies a bug in the design, rectification needs to be performed so that it matches the given specification. Assuming that the circuit can be rectified at a single net, we show how to compute a rectification function at that net using a computer algebra model. The algorithmic approaches are based on the Grobner basis algorithm, which is used as a quantification procedure to compute a rectification function. This paper investigates the application to integer arithmetic circuits while presenting new theory and techniques to rectify integer multiplier circuits. As there may exist multiple rectification functions, we use the notion of local donâ€™t cares for the synthesis of additional rectification functions. Experiments are performed over a number of integer arithmetic circuits to demonstrate the efficacy and the limitations of our approach.
