{\bf Abstract:} {\it This paper addresses the problem of rectification of
buggy integer arithmetic circuits using concepts from symbolic
computer algebra and algebraic geometry. When formal verification
identifies the presence of a bug in the implemented circuit,
logic rectification needs to be performed at local nets so that the
circuit implementation matches the given specification. Assuming that
the circuit admits rectification at a single net, we show how to
compute a rectification function at that net using an algebraic
model. The approach is based on Gr\"obner basis techniques, which are
used as a quantification procedure to compute a rectification
function. We demonstrate the application to rectification of integer
multiplier circuits, while presenting new theory and techniques that
associate the algebraic computations to the presence of local don't
care sets. This gives us a complete approach to compute Boolean
functions that can rectify the buggy circuit. Experiments are
performed over integer multipliers that demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach.}
